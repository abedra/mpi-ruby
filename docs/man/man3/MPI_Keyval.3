MPI::Keyval.create(uniq)
Returns a new MPI::Keyval.  If uniq is true, then the attribute
associated with a keyval will be deleted from the original communicator
to which it was attached when that communicator is duplicated.
If uniq is false, then the attribute will simply be copied to the
new communicator.
